These are the original prototypes for BedrockConnect, thought I would throw them in here for the hell of it. Originally the BedrockConnect serverlist was going to be done through the browser, and you would change the server you want to join in the browser application.
I later realized the potential of the 'transfer' packet that Bedrock Edition has that allows you to transfer players to other servers, so I ended up switching to the ingame serverlist, which is definitely better!
